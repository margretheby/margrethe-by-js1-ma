<strong>Question 7:</strong>

Create a function that has one parameter called list.

Inside the function, loop through the list parameter and console log the name property in each object.

Call the function and pass in the cats variable in the script.js file in the repo.


<strong>Question 8:</strong>

Create a function called createCats. The function will have one parameter called cats.

Inside the function loop through the value passed in as cats and create HTML for each object in the array.

Wrap each item in a div, each name property in an h5 tag and each age property in a p tag.

If the age property is missing, it should display “Age unknown” instead.
